This project is a responsive, design-focused To-Do List interface built using only HTML and CSS.
Inspired by a cute Kawaii-style Figma layout, it features rounded  buttons and a soft pink color
theme, and clean typography with center alignment. The layout is fully mobile-friendly using media
queries, and an optional bunny image adds charm to the design. The project was created to practice
translating UI designs into code, focusing on structure, styling, and responsiveness without using
any JavaScript functionality.
What I Learned

- How to follow a UI/UX design from Figma
- Using flexbox for layout and alignment
- Creating a responsive UI using media queries
- The importance of attention to design detail without JavaScript



 Challenges

- Matching the exact spacing and colors from the design
- Ensuring that elements stayed within screen bounds on mobile
- Finding a cute font that resembles the Figma design
